# Pre-analysis-Data-cleaning
With this R script, we examined missing values, potential controlled variables, and distribution of variables of interest. Some basic visualization is also included here.

Before an fMRI/MRI projects, an overview of a whole dataset is an necessary and initial step. We should be clear on what we have, and make a decision on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Basically, the script shows how to replace values under some specific conditions, to fix missing values, and to use ggstatsplot to create violin / histogram/ correlation graphs.
